You are given a string 5 of length Q and an integer N.
Process S according to the following steps and print the resultant string, X.
1)if Q is odd make it even by adding a '$' at the end of S 
2)Once Q is even insert a string "&i&" at the exact middle of S at every iteration (0<=i<=9). Now is odd,
3) As Q is odd it has to be made even. Now, S should be added at the beginning, in short. 
   '$' should be added at front of end of string alterately to make even This procedure is performed N times to make a new string X. Print X.

Read the input from STDIN and print the output to STDOUT.
Do not write artstrary strings while reading the input or while printing, as these contribute to the standard output
Constraints:
1)0<=Q<=100
2) 0 <= N <= 1000
3) String can have any type of character like alphanumeric or special characters. Space is also considered as a character.


Input Format:
First line has a string, S.
Second line has an integer, N.

Output Format:
Single line of output contains the resultant string, X.

Sample Input1:
abcd
5

Sample Output:
$$ab&0&&2&&4&3&&1&&cd$$

Explanation1
From the Sample Input 1, S-abcd Length of S, Q-4. N-5.
Iteration 1: Since Q is an even number, add "&0&" at the middle of S and thus X-ab&0&cd
             Now Q is odd and it has to be made even by adding $ at the end of X. Thus X-ab&0&cd$ 
Iteration 2: Now Q is even add "&1&" at the middle of X. X-ab&0&1&&cd$.
             Now Q is odd this time '$' has to be added at the beginning of X to make Q even. Thus X- $ab&0&1&&cd$
Iteration 3: Now Q is even,add '&2&' at the middle of X makes it $ab&0&&2&1&&cd$
             Now Q is odd,add $ at the end of X,thus X-$ab&0&&2&1&&cd$$.
Iteration 4: Now Q is even,add &3& at the middle of X.Thus X- $ab&0&&2&3&&1&&cd$$. 
             Now Q is odd,add $ at the beginning of X,thus X = $$ab&0&&2&3&&1&&cd$$
Iteration 5: Now Q is even,add &4& at the middle of X.Thus X becomes $$ab&0&&2&&4&3&&1&&cd$$,which is printed as output.

Sample Input 2:
abc
4

Sample Output 2:
$$ab&&1&&3&2&&0&c$$

Explanation2
From the Sample Input 2, S-abc. Length of S, Q-3. N=4.
Iteration 1:abc$
            ab&0&c$
Iteration2:$ab&0&c$
           $ab&&1&0&c$
Iteration3:$ab&&1&0&c$$
           $ab&&1&2&&0&c$$
Iteration4:$$ab&&1&2&&0&c$$
           $$ab&&1&&3&2&&0&C$$
